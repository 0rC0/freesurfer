These files were created using the following code. Note that 
lh and rh are the same. The ?h.sphere.reg files *should*
be the same as ?h.sphere.ico7.reg. The xyz's are the same. 

for(k=0; k <= 7; k++){
  printf("%d\n",k);
  mris = ReadIcoByOrder(k, 100);
  sprintf(tmpstr,"lh.sphere.ico%d.reg",k);
  MRISwrite(mris,tmpstr);
  sprintf(tmpstr,"rh.sphere.ico%d.reg",k);
  MRISwrite(mris,tmpstr);
}

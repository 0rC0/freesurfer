% X = fast_sched2Xfir(tPres,ntrs,TR,TER,TPreStim,TimeWindow,W)
%
% Creates a design matrix (aka stimulus convolution matrix) modeling
% the hemodynamic response as an FIR with adjustable tap weights. The
% matrix is for a single event type whose schedule is passed by tPres.
% The size of the matrix will be ntrs by Nh, Nh = TimeWindow/TER.
%
% tPres - list of presentation times (ie, the schedule) in seconds 
% for one event type. Time=0 is defined as the time the first stored 
% image was collected (ie, ignore discarded acquisitions). An event
% before t=0 will have an effect on the matrix if its Post Stimulus 
% Window encompasses t=0; otherwise it is ignored. Events found
% after the termination of data collection are ignored (a warning 
% is printed). If tPres is empty, a matrix of zeros is returned. 
%
% ntrs - number of functional volumes collected (do not include 
% discarded acquisitions or prescan time).
%
% TR - TR of the exmperiment (ie, time between acquisitions of 
% functional volumes) in seconds.
%
% TER - temporal estimation resolution (in seconds). This is the
% resolution at which the hemodynamic response is reconstructed.
% The TER must be an integer divisor of the TR. Note: arbitrary
% schedules cannot be used to perform sub TR estimation. The 
% schudule must have been designed for that purpose.
%
% TPreStim - prestimulus window (in seconds). This creates a matrix
% which will allow averaging to begin before the stimulus onset.
% Must be a integer multiple of the TER.
%
% TimeWindow - total time window (in seconds) in which the hemodynamic
% response will be modeled, including the TPreStim. Must be a integer 
% multiple of the TER. The Post Stimulus Window = TimeWindow - TPreStim.
%
% W - presentation weighting. Length should be NPresentations. The
% matrix entry for each presentation is given the value W(n) instead
% of 1. Ignored if W=[].

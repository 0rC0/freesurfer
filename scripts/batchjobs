#  batchjobs
#
# SYNOPSIS
#
#  batchjobs logfile cmdfile1 [cmdfile2 ...]
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#  batchjobs is a worker-bee for the recon-all script, to
#  support running multiple instances of a binary (ie running 
#  in parallel).  The main hurdles to running recon-all binaries
#  in parallel is making sure to get the return code, and to
#  buffer the log files (otherwise, if the output of parallel jobs
#  are simultaneously sent to the log file, then the log file
#  becomes an interleaved mess).
#
#  batchjobs takes at least two arguments.  The first is the
#  filename to which command output should be appended when the
#  command (job) is finished.
#  The next argument(s) are files containing the command string
#  to execute.

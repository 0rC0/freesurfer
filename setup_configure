# For a new dev/ environment, before running configure, 
# and anytime after a Makefile.am file has changed, 
# the following commands must be executed within the 
# dev/ directory:

rm -rf autom4te.cache
aclocal
if ( "`uname -s`" == "Darwin" ) then 
    glibtoolize --force
else
    libtoolize --force
endif
autoreconf --force
#automake Note: autoreconf --force runs automake
autoconf

# The first three commands create the platform specific 
# tools needed by configure (use glibtoolize on the Mac 
# in place of libtoolize). These platform specific tools 
# are placed in the dev/config directory. 
# Autoreconf --force and automake create the Makefile.in 
# files from the Makefile.am files in each directory. 
# Following successful execution of these commands, the 
# configure command can be executed.

# Dev Setup for Samseg Python Port

These instructions apply to a freshly built and upgraded machine running Ubuntu 16.04 and is intended as a reference guide. For a Linux system already set up for develpment, many of these steps can be skipped or appropriately altered.
## Create a dev environment:

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential \
            tcsh \
            libtool-bin \
            libtool \
            automake \
            gfortran \
            libglu1-mesa-dev \
            libfreetype6-dev \
            uuid-dev \
            libxmu-dev \
            libxmu-headers \
            libxi-dev \
            libx11-dev \
            libxml2-utils \
            libxt-dev \
            libjpeg62-dev \
            libxaw7-dev \
            liblapack-dev
sudo apt-get install git
sudo apt-get install gcc-4.8 g++-4.8 libgfortran-4.8-dev
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-4.8 50
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-4.8 50
sudo apt-get install python3-dev
```
Most recent _ITK_ requires cmake 3.95 or greater. Test with 

`cmake --version`.

Download and install `cmake-3.10.2-Linux-x86_64.sh`
You may need to copy it to standard location to get it working.
```
sudo cp -r bin /usr/
sudo cp -r doc /usr/share/
sudo cp -r man /usr/share/
sudo cp -r share /usr/
```
## Acquire Source Code
Create a working directory. This document this will refer to it as `~/work/cm`.
```bash
cd ~/work/cm
```
Get the latest ITK:
```bash
git clone https://itk.org/ITK.git
```
Get the porting branch of FreeSurfer and install pybind11:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/innolitics/freesurfer.git
cd freesurfer
git checkout  nf-gems2-python-port
cd GEMS2
git clone https://github.com/pybind/pybind11.git
```
## Build from Source
### Build ITK
```bash
cd ~/work/cm
mkdir ITK-build
cd ITK-build
cmake ../ITK
make -j4
```
### Build GEMS2python
In the GEMS2 directory run the ccmake utility
```
cd ~/work/cm/freesurfer/GEMS2
ccmake .
```
Use the `t` option to see the advanced mode optiosn. Then set the `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS` and `CMAKE_C_FLAGS` to "`-fPIC -fpermissive`".

`BUILD_EXECUTABLES` `BUILD_GUI` `BUILD_MATLAB` `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` and `BUILD_TESTING` should be `OFF`.

Check that the `PYTHON_EXECUTABLE` and `PYTHON_LIBRARY` have valid values such as `/usr/bin/python3.5` 
and `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython3.5m.so` respectively.

Build the GEMS2 code with:
```bash
cmake .
make -j4
```
## Python Setup
Install the python virtual environment tools:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --user virtualenv
pip install --user virtualenvwrapper
```
To take full advantage add this to the end of your `.bashrc` file in your home directory:
```bash
export ITK_DIR=$HOME/work/cm/ITK-build
# where to store our virtual envs
export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/virtenvs
# where projects will reside
export PROJECT_HOME=$HOME/Projects-Active
# where is the virtualenvwrapper.sh
source $HOME/.local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
```
After changing `~/.bashrc` either open a new terminal or do a `source ~/.bashrc`

Locate the python 3 interpreter executable:
```bash
which python3
```
For purposes of this document ```/usr/bin/python3``` will the presumed location.

Now create a `gems2` virtual environment using the correct location of your python3:
```bash
mkvirtualenv gems2 -p /usr/bin/python3
```
The command prompt will indicate you are using this environment with a `(gems2)` prefix.
Having created `gems2` you can enter this environment in any terminal shell by using:
```bash
workon gems2
```
At this point any python packages installed will be local to that environment 
and not interfere with any other python projects, which is the purpose of using virtual environments.

Verify with:
```
which python
```
You should see something like `~/virtenvs/gems2/bin/python3`

Install the python requirements:
```bash
pip install -r as_python/requirements.txt
```

## Test and Run

## Running Samseg Code
The matlab script `run_samseg.m` has been ported to `run_samseg_ported.py` with the same command line arguments. 

A minor difference is the use of `-i` and `-o` with single dash instead of `--i` and `--o`
Running with `-h` for help will print a complete usage statement:
```bash
usage: run_samseg_ported.py [-h] [-o FOLDER] [-i FILE] [--threads THREADS]
                            [-r FILE] [-m LABEL] [--showfigs] [--nobrainmask]
                            [--diagcovs] [-v]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o FOLDER, --output FOLDER
                        output to FOLDER
  -i FILE, --input FILE
                        input image(s) from FILE
  --threads THREADS     number of threads
  -r FILE, --regmat FILE
                        skip registration and read from FILE
  -m LABEL, --missing LABEL
                        LABEL is a missing structure (repeat for multiple
                        missing labels)
  --showfigs            show figures during run
  --nobrainmask         no initial brain masking based on affine atlas
                        registration
  --diagcovs            use diagonal covariance matrices (only affect multi-
                        contrast case)
  -v, --verbose         verbose debug output
```
The following will run test case 008 directly:
```bash
cd ~/work/cm/freesurfer
workon gems2
export PYTHONPATH=".:./GEMS2/bin"
export SAMSEG_DATA_DIR=$HOME/work/cm/innolitics_testing/atlas/20Subjects_smoothing2_down2_smoothingForAffine2
python ./as_python/samseg/run_samseg_ported.py \
   -o $HOME/work/cm/innolitics_testing/python_temp_data/008 \
    -i $HOME/work/cm/innolitics_testing/buckner40/008/orig.mgz
```

## Running Test Scripts
Place the `innolitics_testing` data folder at `~/work/cm/`

Get ready to run a test with:
```bash
cd ~/work/cm/freesurfer
workon gems2
export PYTHONPATH=".:./GEMS2/bin"
export TESTING_DIR=$HOME/work/cm/innolitics_testing/buckner40
export SAMSEG_DATA_DIR=$HOME/work/cm/innolitics_testing/atlas/20Subjects_smoothing2_down2_smoothingForAffine2
```
Again, after changing `~/.bashrc` either open a new terminal or do a `source ~/.bashrc`

At this point individual tests can be run with
```bash
python ./as_python/samseg/dev_utils/run_samseg_test_case.py 004
```
Multiple tests can be run by listing them on the command line:
```bash
python ./as_python/samseg/dev_utils/run_samseg_test_case.py 004 008 140
```
Or all of the tests can be run by leaving the command line arguments empty:
```bash
python ./as_python/samseg/dev_utils/run_samseg_test_case.py
```
results will appear, one folder per case, in `~/work/cm/innolitics_testing/buckner40/python_temp_data/`

Dice measurements can be calculated using:
```bash
export GOLD_REFERENCE_DIR=$HOME/work/cm/innolitics_testing/tests/matlab_nov20/
python ./as_python/samseg/dev_utils/measure_and_report.py 004 008 140
```
Leaving off case numbers will report against all cases.

## Development Cycle

Changes to Python code are reflected immediately next time you invoke the Python script. Editing the C++ code 
will require you to run `make` again in the GEMS2 directory. This should recompile the module in place and 
you can re-run Python scripts that will load in the rebuilt module automatically.

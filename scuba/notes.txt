x ScubaFrame gets a ScubaToolState, tcl function for getting tool ID
x scuba.tcl makes gaTool(id,...), gets id from frame=gaFrame(id,toolID)
x View adds ScubaToolState to its mouse/key events, ScubaFrame passes
x View calls Layer::HandleTool ( RAS, ToolState, InputState )


x - should set,get,min/max stuff be in VolumeCollection? Layer is doing a lot of stuff

save window size and position on quit

option menus for data collections in label dlogs

- volume drawing caching
  - problem is voxel sizes, so what if we resize and align the volume so that each voxel == 1 RAS point, and then create a volume of xyz translations, map<float[3],float[3]>, so the left-side RAS coords can just be rint-ed ... this would work for voxel size < 1, but waht about > 1, maybe just a matter of fixing the bounds

x - edge line
x  - on handle tool, find shortest path based on volume
x  - add buffer bound info to view state

    x SetCursor() sets cursor marker
    x SetMarker() sets next marker, wrapping around
  x have some kind of 'lock on cursor' option in the view

- edge line
  - parameters for favoring straightness, edge values
    - working on it, need to see what function should be

- use transform.h TransformRead to load transforms
  - need TransformCompose to get single matrix

- add 'selectable' flag to layer

DRAWING TOOLS:::

- connecting lines
- save reload lines

- write docs for jean and david

BRUCE'S LIST:::

x data collection transform 
- markers
- b/c controled by mouse, perhaps mod+mouse when nav tool is on


BUGS:::
- fix radius in brush, it's really ugly
- tabbing when in console switches frame, disable?
- brings up tkcon window briefly when booting
- sometimes filling returns an error with NewTask tcl cmd
- crashing on ROI fill
- markers and cursor draw at different slices when zoomed in

FUTURE IDEAS:::

Save Scene
 - save a script file to automatically load in data and set up view state like current one

nav tools draw onscreen sliders for feedback
 - on mouse down with right tool, draw scale bar
 - function to translate v position into modifcation value
 - start at mouse point, use expo scale towards edge for min/max values

Freesurfer compilation/installation
===================================

If you have /usr/pubsw/packages, then you only do

./configure --prefix=$installdir
./make
./make install

(if you do not specify prefix, then the install directory is /usr/local,
 which you may not have rights to install.)

If you have mni installed somewhere, then you change the configure line to:

./configure --prefix=$installdir --with-mni-dir=$mnidir

You can see all the options by 

./configure --help

Please send email to tosa@nmr.mgh.harvard.edu if you have problems.

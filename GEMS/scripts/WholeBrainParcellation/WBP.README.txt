For location of 39 Buckner data and instructions on how to build the aseg atlas, see:

  http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/AtlasSubjects?highlight=%28atlas%29%7C%28rebuild%29

They end up being at /autofs/space/dijon_032/users/salat/RBnew . Each subject has a file called 'seg_edited.mgz' in its mri directory, which is 
a symbolic link to the most recent valid edited aseg volume. Demographic info for those 39 subjects is found in the file 'demographics'.

There doesn't seem to be any consistency across subjects of what MR volumes
really mean: nu.mgz, brain.mgz, skullstripped.mgz, norm.mgz etc are sometimes skull-stripped, sometimes not. Let's just always use orig.mgz instead, as well as and seg_edited.mgz for obvious reasons.

Everything in FreeSurfer lives in MNI305 space: in the recon-all stream, the registration tool mri_em_register registers (without resampling) each subject affinely to the FreeSurfer volumetric probabilistic atlas, which itself is mapped to the $FREESURFER_HOME/average/mni305.cor.mgz file (by co-registering the first subject of the Buckner39 data to that template). Note: the talairach_avi script, which calculates an affine transform to Talairach space as well very early in the recon-all stream, is actually *only* used to estimate ICV and *never* for anything else (!).

So all things considered, let's also work with FreeSurfer's mni305.cor.mgz template, so that later we could potentially use the extremely robust FreeSurfer stream to do the initial affine coregistration needed to start our segmentation process.


=============

Note that only 39 out of the 40 are actually used. In csh, do

  source /autofs/space/dijon_032/users/salat/RBnew/scripts/subjects.csh
  echo $SUBJECTS
  echo $#SUBJECTS

The reply will be:

and 

  39

which shows that are only 39 subjects. The following subjects are missing (i.e., not used):

  981113_vc626
  990910_vc1265

In addition, there is a subject vc763 as well!

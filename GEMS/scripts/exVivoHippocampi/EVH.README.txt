(Labeling log)

All data is symlinked to:
/autofs/space/rock_004/users/hires

within the case's directory (which is in the rock/4 dir) you will find a few scans, mainly hires and one lowres. Original low res scans are called recon/mef* or lowres/mef* (multi echo flash); the rest is done automatically using tool chain described in http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu:8080/fswiki/ExvivoRecons. The high res is only one /mri/flash/flash20_*_avg.mgz that is labeled manually.

Some of these subjects have in vivo scans, which can be found /autofs/space/rock_004/users/hires/recons; typically called *_invivo but Allison will look into this to make sure.

About the cases:
 *FHS = Framingham Heart Study, some of which have in vivo's
 *I = MGH main campus subjects, only one has in vivo scan
